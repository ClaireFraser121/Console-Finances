# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

Hey there! In this README, I'll take you through my experience of completing the Financial Analysis Challenge. This challenge was an exciting opportunity to put my JavaScript skills to the test by working on a real-world problem. I was provided with a financial dataset and tasked with creating code to analyse it. Let me share my journey with you.

## Getting Started

As a student, I found it important to have a structured approach to tackle this challenge. Here's how I got started:

1. I created and cloned the project repository to my local machine. This allowed me to have a local copy of the starter code and the financial dataset.

2. I opened the `starter/index.js` file in my preferred code editor. This is where I would write the JavaScript code to analyse the financial records.

## Implementation

The heart of the challenge was the implementation. Here are the key steps I followed:

1. **Initializing Variables:** I began by setting up variables to store the results. This included variables for the total number of months, total Profit/Losses, and placeholders for the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

2. **Data Processing:** I then used a loop to go through the financial records, which were stored in an array. Within this loop, I calculated the total months and total Profit/Losses.

3. **Calculating Changes:** To find the average change in Profit/Losses, I computed the change from month to month and kept track of the total change.

4. **Finding the Extremes:** I identified the greatest increase and decrease in profits by comparing changes and updating the respective variables.

5. **Displaying Results:** Finally, I displayed the results in the console, showing the total months, total Profit/Losses, average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease.

## Running the Code

To see the results of my analysis, I ran the code in a JavaScript environment like a browser's developer console. The financial analysis was displayed there, giving me a clear view of how well my code was performing.

## Example Output

For a glimpse of what my output might look like, here's a sample screenshot:
